# Golwer
A small mod introducing the Flower Golem 🌻, a creature that peacefully roams the world. Just like other golems, it can be summoned by players. Its unique ability? When near crops, it lovingly pollinates them, adding a touch of magic to your farming
> This is the first mod I make as to experiment on the topic and as a learning experience 🧪

This mod adds a cute creature to the world. You spawn it by crafting two new blocks, the flower block 💐 and the flowered carved pumpkin 🎃. Then by placing the latter over the first one it will be summoned. You have now a new friend.

This little creature on occasions when near growables (All crops and sweet berry bushes) will pollinate them, speeding up their growth. Just like bees 🌱
